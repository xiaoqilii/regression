# Regression package

This Regression package includes classes which allow easy implementation of *OLS*, *WLS*, and *Ridge* estimator linear models and an *ANOVA* model. For all tests and confidence intervals of the OLS model, we are assuming a *Gaussian* linear model.

To use this package in your own project, simply put the **regression** folder in the project directory and import the required classes and methods as shown in each section below.
